# üí° The digital Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)

- Interest in computational methods has grown substantially in the last decade
- One strain of digital SSH: research built on "more data than you can read"
- NLP tools are becoming an integral part of research outside of CS and Linguistics


---

# CLARIN

- Develop an infrastructure to facilitate NLP ‚ù§Ô∏è SSH research
- Part of the CLARINO mandate: build a portal for NLP applications focusing on users with no NLP background

### ü§î Undertaking such a project raises questions:

- How should a system the facilitates NLP tools use be designed?
- Can off-the-shelf tools be integrated? 
- What's a good/scalable/coherent way to do it?
- And what's the point?

# <!--- fit ---> üí° Classifier evaluation scores as a quantity of interest

- In a parliamentary setting, the contents of a speech should reflect the
ideology of the speaker.
- Use party classification scores for parliamentary analysis!

---
### For example: Measure polarization

- Higher accuracy ‚Üí more polarized*
- Hirst et al** do it for the Canadian Parliament
    - and find that position is a much stronger signal than policy!

### ...Or ask more involved questions

- Are newcomers to the EU parliament joining groups based on ideology or convenience?***

# Text-as-data pre-processing cookbook

- üèÖ Grimmer and Stewart (2013)* survey the text-as-data field, warning of the dangers of "one-size-fits-all" experiments
- ü§î They also introduce a recipe for pre-processing, with emphasis on stemming and normalization
- üôÑ Dismissal of expensive techniques that "do little to enhance performance", e.g. context, disambiguation, lemmatization and so on

# Text-as-data pre-processing cookbook

- The recipe becomes gospel
- Even attempts to address the effects of pre-processing on political analysis provide alternate recipes using the same ingredients*
- Experiments miss out on potentially useful (and contentfully significant) tools and techniques!

## **L**ap e**X**change **F**ormat

- Scalable to linguistic annotations beneath and above the token level
- Applicable to a wide a range of linguistic phenomena and text annotations
- Scalable to large data volumes

---
## The **L**anguage **A**nnotation **F**ramework*

An abstract data model: represent arbitrary text **annotations** in a graph. **Nodes** and **edges** organize the structure and the relations of the annotations, and refer to **regions** in the original data.
- Purpose: full interoperability across annotation formats.
- Machine readable instantiations of the data model exist, but are focused on _representation_ rather than _interchange_.

---

- **LXF** builds on and expands LAF, focusing on intermediate graph representations and building a graph incrementally
- Achieves scalability, both representational and computational, while staying faithful to the original design

- An open, plug-and-research resource for text-as-data experimentation

---
# <!--- fit ---> F1 as a quantity of interest, in Norway

- Marked improvements with better normalization, disambiguation and context
- Mixing linguistic and meta-data features helps, too
- Pre-processing does matter for the substance of the analysis

- Heterogenous workflows of off-the-shelf NLP tools can be made easily accessible without sacrificing scalability and flexibility
- Easy access to NLP pre-processing tools benefits political research and analysis

---

# üé® üèó LAP & LXF 
- A modular system for HPC-ready, user friendly language annotations
- Scalable to large volumes of data and heterogenous linguistic (and non-linguistic!) annotation

---

# üí° Talk of Norway
- An open resource for parliamentary analysis, informed by and developed with Political Scientists
- The first ToN experiments show substantive differences in the analyses built on party classification performance

On their own, the meta data variables are useful for statistics (what do younger vs. older MEP talk about?), and can be used in combination with the linguistic annotations to quickly go from raw data to policies

# What is an NLP tool?

- Tokenizers, PoS taggers, lemmatizers, syntactic parsers +++
- Come in many flavors, adhere to different traditions, have different pros and cons (depending on the task)
- It's a good idea to test different tools before settling for one for a given task!

---
# Tool interoperability and interchange formats

```shell
 Sandy NNP
 barks NNS
 .     .
```

```shell
 1 Sandy _ _ NNP _ _ _ _ _
 2 barks _ _ NNS _ _ _ _ _
 3 .     _ _ . _ _ _ _ _
```

```shell
 1 Sandy _ _ NNP _ 2 nn    _ _
 2 barks _ _ NNS _ 0 null  _ _
 3 .     _ _ .   _ 2 punct _ _

---
# What is a workflow?

- Combine tools to get annotations for some downstream task (linguistic or otherwise)
- Tools better be compatible


![bg right 100%](figures/workflow.svg)

---
## What is a portal?

- No local installation is required
- Data upload and results download
- Graphical user interface to configuring and running tools
- Not developer tools like **NLTK** and **SpaCy**!

## What is big data?
- Big enough to make processing it on a laptop impractical

---

# LAP Architecture

![bg width:500px](figures/lap-diagram.svg)

## Graphical user interface

- LAP is GUI agnostic
- Blazing the trail for using Galaxy for NLP

# Our perspective

- Thoroughly navigating the NLP sea before doing political analysis means no
political analysis 
- Building NLP-for-SSH infrastructures might just be a good idea
- Doing it without navigating the SSH sea likely is not: if we build it, will they come?
